/*
   Drawbot position function

   Inverse Kinematics -
   Function for the angle (length) of members to determine the position of an effector

   A drawbot (a.k.a. polargraph) is robot that uses a pen as an effector tethered by two stepper motors from two distant postions
   the drawbot traverses its working area by shortening and or lengthening the tethers of from the steppers.

// TODO - Task 1: Write a function that changes the length cable from a stepper motor. ie void changeLength(int millimeters)
// TODO - Task 2: write a function that takes a boolean and writes two different positions (actual values to be determined later) for a servo. ie void marker(boolean draw)
// TODO - Task 3: write a function that takes an (x,y) co-ordinate where (0,0) is the top left corner of the drawing canvas and converts to an equivalent (L1, L2) where L1 is the length of tether 1 and L2 is the length of teather 2
// TODO - Task 4: overload the function from task 2 to take a second boolean parameter that changes the length of the stepper by an absolute or relative ammount.
//        def: relative the length of the tether changes BY the value of the argument passed.
//        def: absolute the length of the tether changes TO the value of the argument passed.
//        e.g.: void changeLength(int millimeters, boolean absoulte)
